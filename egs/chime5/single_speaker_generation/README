This GitHub branch contains the cleaned single-speaker segmentation and
resulting overlap mixture lists, along with the scripts used to generate them,
for the CHiME-5 corpus.

The single-speaker output is in Kaldi-style data directories:
  data/{dev,train}_final/<microphone>

The mixture outputs are in the "mixes" directory.

The two scripts are:
  run_create_single_spk.sh - creates single-speaker cleaned segments
  run_create_mix_lists.sh - creates the mixture lists from the cleaned segments

There are also two scripts provided that are of use:
  local/data_dir_to_wav.sh - creates utterance .wav files from Kaldi data dir
  local/filelist_to_mixlist.py - constructs overlap mix lists from filelists

Detailed info on the output and scripts is below.



******************************************
*** Single-Speaker Segmentation Output ***

The single-speaker segmentation is distributed in the form of Kaldi-style data
directories (more info here: http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/data_prep.html). They are
broken down by dev/train subset and then microphone condition (with the
close-talking condition consisting of the corresponding speaker's binaural mic
for each utterance). They consist of 4 files:
  wav.scp
  segments
  utt2spk
  spk2utt

The wav.scp file is a mapping from recording-ID to the audio file, i.e.
<reco-ID> <audio-file>

The segments file defines utterances, the recording they are from, and the
start and end time for the utterance, i.e.
<utt-ID> <reco-ID> <start> <end>
By convention, the utterance ID is of the form:
<reco-ID>_<speaker-ID>_<start-frame>_<end-frame>
Since the utterance ID contains the recording ID as well as the start and end
frame, it encodes the entire information required for recovering the utterance
from the recording audio file.

The utt2spk file is a mapping from utterance-ID to speaker-ID, i.e.
<utt-ID> <spk-ID>

The spk2utt file is a mapping from speaker-ID to utterance-IDs, i.e.
<spk-ID> <utt-ID-1> <utt-ID-2> [...]


In addition, there are a number of supplemental files that are useful and have
been provided, that are within the data/{dev,train}_final directories:
  key.txt
  utt_equivalences.txt

The key.txt file is a table of all of the close-talking segments along with a
value of 0 or 1, depending on if they passed the xvector speaker-ID
verification stage. This way it is possible to recover more segments of
generally lower quality if desired.

The utt_equivalences.txt file contains all of the utterances across every
microphone, with each line consisting of all the different microphones that
recorded a spoken utterance. Given that the microphones were not synchronous,
it is not trivial to map speech across microphones, and this table contains
that information.



****************************
*** Mixture List Outputs ***

The mixture lists have been constructed to parallel the lists released by MERL
for the WSJ0 dataset, along with being compatible with the code they released
for creating the overlapping audio
(http://www.merl.com/demos/deep-clustering/create-speaker-mixtures.zip).

The files are of the format:
<audio1> <SNR1> <audio2> <SNR2>
The audio identifier is of the form:
<data-subset>/<microphone>/<utterance-ID>.wav
The utterance-ID form is explained above, and contains all of the information
necessary to construct the utterance from the recording audio file.



***************************************************
*** Single-Speaker Segmentation Generation Code ***

The top-level script for the code used to generate single-speaker segmentation
is:
run_create_single_spk.sh

It is not possible to run this script end-to-end, as the Speech Activity
Detection model I used has not been publicly released. The xvector system has
been, and must be downloaded prior to running. If you would like to run the
full cleanup, you must either run your own SAD system or rely on only the
annotations for finding single-speaker segments. Either way, you must replace
stage 3 with appropriate code. It should produce data/{dev,train}_sad_seg data
directories, where the "segments" file must contain the output of the SAD, or
if SAD is ommitted, segments that consist of the full recording.

The breakdown of the stages of the script is as follows:
Stage 1: Basic data prep of the raw corpus to Kaldi data directories
Stage 2: Cross-referencing transcripts to generate basic single-speaker regions
Stage 3: Running an ASR Speech Activity Detection system
Stage 4: Merging stages 2-3 to create high-confidence single-speaker regions
Stage 5: Preparation for speaker xvector extraction
Stage 6: Extracting xvectors for each speaker
Stage 7: Preparation for segment xvector extraction
Stage 8: Extracting xvectors for each segment
Stage 9: Scoring segment xvectors against their corresponding speaker
Stage 10: Use high-scoring segemnts to create final segmentation
Stage 11: Produce sample single-speaker .wav files



************************************
*** Mixture List Generation Code ***

The top-level script for the code used to generate mixture lists is:
run_create_mix_lists.sh

This script takes the output of the single-speaker segmentation and creates
mixture lists, particularly the ones used in my experiments. Due to generating
random SNRs, it will *not* produce exact identical output and the lists in this
repository should be used if you would like to evaluate on the datasets I
evaluated on. This code is supplied as a demonstration of usage, enabling usage
for constructing additional datasets from the single-speaker segmentation, of
which there is great potential beyond my usage.

Stage 1 demonstrates the construction of filelists from a Kaldi data directory
and then using the local/filelist_to_mixlist.py script to generate mixtures
from that filelist.

Stage 2 demonstrates the usage of the utt_equivalences.txt file to map a
mixture list across microphones, to create cross-micrphone versions of the
exact same utterance mixtures.



**************************
*** Additional Scripts ***

The local/data_dir_to_wav.sh script can produce .wav files of segments from a
Kaldi-style data directory. This can be useful for preparing single-speaker
.wav files for use with the MERL overlap-generation scripts. An example of how
to use this script is in Stage 11 of the run_create_single_spk.sh script.
When using this script in preparation for overlap-generation, it is important
to ensure all of the utterances used in your overlap dataset *are* actually
contained within the data directory you are using to generate its input.

The local/filelist_to_mixlist.py script can produce a mixture list of a target
number of trials given a filelist. Demonstration of this script is in Stage 1
of the run_create_mix_lists.sh file. It is important that the structure of the
file names in the filelist matches the above description, as the script reads
information on the speaker and utterance length from the filename.
